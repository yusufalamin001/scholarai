## 📖 About ScholarAI

ScholarAI is a full-stack, AI-powered web application that helps university students study smarter. Students upload their course materials, ask questions grounded in their own documents, track what topics they have covered, generate mock exam quizzes, collaborate with peers in shared study rooms, and plan their study schedule — all from a single responsive platform that works on desktop and mobile.

What makes ScholarAI different from generic AI tools is its **discipline-aware AI layer**. The system automatically adapts its behaviour based on the student's faculty — providing step-by-step engineering calculations with equation rendering for Engineering students, statute citation and legal reasoning for Law students, clinical explanations for Medical students, and general academic support for everyone else.

The platform is built on a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture, meaning the AI answers questions strictly from the student's own uploaded documents — not from generic internet knowledge.

## 🧠 Discipline-Aware AI — Faculty Prompt Library

ScholarAI uses a dynamic system prompt that adapts to the student's faculty at runtime. The RAG pipeline stays identical across all faculties — only the prompt changes:

| Faculty | AI Behaviour |
|---|---|
| ⚙️ Engineering & Sciences | Step-by-step calculations, correct notation, KaTeX rendering, derivations |
| ⚖️ Law | Statute citation, case law references, structured IRAC legal argument |
| 🏥 Medicine & Health Sciences | Anatomy, physiology, pharmacology — clinically relevant, no diagnostic advice |
| 📊 Business & Management | Financial models, frameworks, structured case study analysis |
| 📖 General / Other | Clear, balanced academic tutor style across any subject |

### Request Flow
1. Student selects a course and submits a question
2. Next.js frontend calls a FastAPI REST endpoint with a Supabase JWT token
3. Backend authenticates the request and reads the student's faculty
4. Backend loads the appropriate faculty system prompt from the prompt library
5. The pipeline embeds the question with Jina and retrieves the 5 most relevant chunks from the Supabase pgvector store, scoped to that course
6. Chunks + system prompt + question are sent to the Gemini API
7. Response is returned, rendered on the frontend with KaTeX where needed
8. Interaction is logged to PostgreSQL for the topic progress tracker

## ⚙️ Local Setup

### Prerequisites
Verify these are installed before anything else:
```bash
node --version    # Must be v18 or higher
python --version  # Must be 3.11 or higher
git --version     # Any recent version
```

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/scholarai.git
cd scholarai
git checkout develop
```

### 2. Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Open .env.local and fill in your Supabase URL and anon key
npm run dev
# Runs at http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in Supabase + Google API keys
uvicorn main:app --reload
# Runs at http://localhost:8000
# API docs at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### 4. AI Pipeline
```bash
cd ai
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in your Google API key
```

> ⚠️ Backend and AI each have their **own separate virtual environment**. This prevents package conflicts. Always activate the correct venv before working in that folder.

### Environment Variables

**`frontend/.env.local`**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

**`backend/.env`**
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
JINA_API_KEY=your-jina-api-key
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
APP_ENV=development
```

**`ai/.env`**
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
JINA_API_KEY=your-jina-api-key
```

> ⚠️ Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` files. Share values with teammates via WhatsApp only.

## 🌿 Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

| Branch | Purpose | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Production — triggers Vercel deploy | PR required · tested and approved |
| `develop` | Integration — active development | PR required · 1 teammate approval |
| `feature/*` | Individual features | Open PR to develop when complete |
| `fix/*` | Bug fixes | Open PR to develop when fixed |

### Daily Loop

```bash
# Start of every session
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Work and commit often
git add .
git commit -m "feat: describe what you built"

# Push and open PR to develop
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Open PR on GitHub → request review from a teammate → merge after approval
```

### Commit Format

```
feat:     feat: add KaTeX rendering to AI chat component
fix:      fix: resolve ChromaDB collection scoping bug
docs:     docs: update API reference for query endpoint
refactor: refactor: clean up faculty prompt loader
chore:    chore: update Google API key environment variable name
```

### Branch Naming

```
feature/google-auth
feature/course-management
feature/rag-pipeline
feature/ai-chat-interface
feature/progress-tracker
feature/quiz-generator
feature/study-rooms
feature/study-planner
feature/settings-page
fix/katex-mobile-rendering
```

---

## 🔒 Golden Rules

1. Never push directly to `main` or `develop` — always through a PR
2. Never commit `.env` files or API keys to GitHub
3. Every PR to `develop` needs at least **1 teammate approval**
4. `main` only receives merges from `develop` when fully working and tested
5. Delete your feature branch after it is merged
6. Pull from `develop` at the start of every session before creating a branch
7. If you break `develop`, fixing it is your priority before anything else

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

ScholarAI runs entirely on free-tier infrastructure so it costs nothing to
operate. This keeps the project accessible but introduces a few constraints
that would disappear on paid hosting:

| Limitation | Cause | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Cold starts (~50s) | Render free tier spins down idle instances | The first request after a period of inactivity is slow while the backend wakes up |
| Document processing time | Free-tier CPU + embedding via API | A document may take up to a minute to move from "processing" to "ready" |

These are infrastructure constraints, not application bugs. The codebase is
production-ready — moving the backend to a paid Render instance removes the
cold-start delay with no code changes. Embeddings run through the Jina API
(free tier: generous daily quota, no credit card), and the AI chat runs on
the Gemini free tier, so the app has no hard usage cost for a student pilot.
